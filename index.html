    <h1>ATAR</h1>
    <p>The Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) is a rank given to secondary school students on a range from 0 to 99.95.</p>
    <p>The ATAR shows how you performed in your studies compared to other students completing an Australian Year 12 program.</p>
    <p>SATAC <a href="www.calculateatar.com/">calculates the ATAR for SACE</a> and NTCET students.</p>
    
    <h2>What is the ATAR used for?</h2>
    <p>Tertiary institutions use the ATAR to select students for their courses. Course selection can be competitive. This happens when courses have more applicants than places available to offer. For this reason, tertiary institutions need a way of ranking applicants for each course. The ATAR is a fair and transparent tool used to compare the academic results of students for the purpose of tertiary selection.</p>
    
    <h2>How to get an ATAR (SACE/NTCET students)</h2>
    <p>To qualify for an ATAR you first need a university aggregate. SATAC calculates the university aggregate by combining the scaled scores from your best 90 credits of study.</p>
    <p>To be eligible for a university aggregate you need to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Qualify for the SACE/NTCET</li>
        <li>Follow the rules for precluded combinations</li>
        <li>Follow the rules for counting restrictions</li>
        <li>Complete at least 90 credits of study in Tertiary Admissions Subjects (TAS) and Recognised Studies at Stage 2</li>
        <li>Of the 90 credits of study, at least 60 credits must be from 20 credit TAS or valid pairs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The university aggregate is calculated from your best scaled scores from three 20 credit TAS (60 credits) plus the best outcome from the flexible option (30 credits).</p>
    
    <h2>How SATAC calculates the ATAR</h2>
    <p>To calculate an ATAR from your university aggregate, SATAC looks at the percentage of students who achieved the same aggregate as you, or better.</p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You get an aggregate of 78.00 out of 90.00.</li>
        <li>10% of students also get 78.00 out of 90.00 or better.</li>
        <li>The aggregate of 78.00 now corresponds to a rank of 90.00 (100 minus 10).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do this every year for SACE and NTCET students who qualify for a university aggregate. The group of students who qualify for an aggregate in a given year is the cohort.</p>
    <p>Each year the cohort may differ from other years in that it may represent a smaller or larger percentage of the population who are in the same age group. The percentage from the given year is the participation rate.</p>
    
    <h2>Note</h2>
    <p>It is important to remember that the ATAR is a rank, not a score. It compares overall performance across the group, rather than individual performance in specific subjects. Its purpose is to select students for tertiary courses.</p>
